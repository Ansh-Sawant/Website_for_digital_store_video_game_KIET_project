            <h2>Star Wars: Squadrons Gameplay Reveal Shows Dogfighting</h2>
            <p>The gameplay debut of Star Wars: Squadrons looks to borrow parts from the classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter series.

                        EA debuted the first gameplay trailer for Star Wars: Squadrons during its EA Play event, giving us our first look at the dogfighting action game. That included a closer look at the New Republic and Imperial squadrons, customization options, and harrowing dogfights.
                        <br> <br>
                        The star of the trailer was the view from inside the cockpit, showing how you'll engage with most of the moment-to-moment action. That look showed dogfights from a first-person cockpit view,
                        complete with your ship's instruments and an icon of the ship itself with shields that seemed to deplete in parts, similar to the classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter series. The entire game is also playable in VR.

            <h2>The Next Smash Bros. Ultimate Fighter Is Arms' Min Min</h2>
            <p>A cameo from Nintendo's latest competitive game is the next DLC fighter for Smash Bros., 
                and a new presentation showed how she's armed and dangerous.

                        Nintendo held a Smash Bros. Ultimate presentation all about its next DLC character: Min Min from the wacky boxing-like game Arms. A debut trailer showed the various Arms characters knocking each other out over a chance to grab the Smash Bros. invite, only to have Min Min step in and grab it for herself. She's coming on June 29 for $5.99, or as part of the second Fighters Pass. Alongside an in-depth look at Min Min, Nintendo also revealed other new content and features coming for Smash--you can see all of the news about Mii Fighter costumes, Spirits mode, and Amiibo figures below.
                        <br> <br>
                        The debut video was notably different, as Sakurai presented from his own house due to the state of emergency in Japan from the coronavirus. He even took a moment to show off his living room, including his dual-screen setup for multiplayer sessions or watching TV while he plays games.

                        Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red's upcoming RPG, has been delayed once again. Its new release date is set for November 19 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, two months after the previously scheduled September 17 date. A next-generation update that improves performance on Xbox Series X and PS5 will come at launch, with a more substantial update also arriving later.

                        In a statement posted to Twitter, the developer explained that the game is not yet ready for launch, although it is complete in terms of content and gameplay. The additional development time will be used to balance mechanics and fix bugs.

                        The studio shared the announcement on Twitter, with a collage of the many developers working on Ghost of Tsushima while stuck at home in quarantine due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The team said it's "thrilled' to make the announcement and "can't wait to get it into your hands" next month.
